//! Browser-loadable WASM bundle — Phase 2 smoke test for the wasm32
//! cross-compile floor.
//!
//! This crate is the smallest possible consumer of the floor laid in
//! commits `50003ae`..`868c3ac`. It pulls in `holtburger-protocol` and
//! `holtburger-session` as dependencies (verifying both still compile
//! when bundled into a `cdylib`) and exposes a few wasm-bindgen
//! functions so a plain `index.html` can prove the bundle loads and
//! executes.
//!
//! Constructing a `Session` is exercised here as of the
//! `web_time::Instant` swap (spike doc §8 step 3). The remaining
//! deliberate omission is a real transport — wasm32 will plug in
//! `WsTransport` (§8 step 2) over the `Session::new_with_transport`
//! seam.
